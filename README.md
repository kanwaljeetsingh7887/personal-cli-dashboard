## Challenges Faced & Solved
The main challenge was integrating live system stats with Google Calendar events and ensuring smooth real-time updates in the terminal without breaking the logging functionality. We solved it by using **multithreading** and modular Python scripts to separate data fetching, logging, and display, ensuring the dashboard runs efficiently without lag.

## Expected vs Actual Output

| Functionality | Expected Output | Actual Output |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| CPU, Memory, Disk stats | Live stats updating every second | Displayed correctly in terminal |
| Battery % | Correct percentage & charging status | Displayed correctly |
| Weather updates | Current weather for specified city | Displayed correctly |
| Google Calendar | Next event info | Displayed correctly (if credentials valid) |
| Logging | stats_log.csv updated automatically | Working correctly |


## Future Enhancements

* Add network stats (upload/download speed)
* Add news updates
* Export dashboard to web (Flask/Django)
* Dark/light theme support for CLI
